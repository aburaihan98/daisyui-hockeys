# Peddy

Peddy is a dynamic web application that displays a collection of pets available for adoption or sale. The project fetches real-time data from an API, sorts the pets by price, and presents them in a responsive grid layout with images. Users can browse and view pet details, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience across all devices.
